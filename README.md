# CarDekho-Used-Car-Price-Prediction
Given a diverse dataset containing information about used cars, including features like car model, age, mileage, fuel type, kilometers driven etc, the objective is to build an accurate machine learning model that will predict the current valuations for used cars, enabling users to make informed decisions when buying or selling pre-owned vehicles.


## Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the data like handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

## Feature Selection and Engineering:
Identify key features that significantly influence used car prices. Perform feature engineering to create new informative features.

## Model Selection:
Choose appropriate regression algorithms for the task, such as decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting. Consider ensembling or stacking multiple models for improved performance.

## Model Training and Evaluation:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected models on the training data. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error, mean absolute error) on the testing data.

## Hyperparameter Tuning:
Fine-tune model hyperparameters to optimize performance.

## Interpretability and Explainability:
Analyze feature importance to understand which factors contribute most to the predicted car prices. Provide insights into how specific features impact  used car prices.

## Deployment:
Once a satisfactory model is developed, deploy it as a user-friendly web application(streamlit).

* Input - Engine_Displacement, Model_Manufactured_Year, Body_Type, Transmission, Model, Mileage, Engine_Type, Location, Km_Driven
